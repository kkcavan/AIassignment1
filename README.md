[One max problem](one-max-problem-final.ipynb)

A problem consisting of a binary string that is 30 bits longs. Where we use a fitness function to rate the strength of an individual based on the number of 1's present in the string. Through a set of operators such as mutation, crossover and selection , we have created a genetic algorithm that breeds stronger individuals through an itereration of generations

[Target String problem](target-string-final.ipynb)

An extension of the one max problem, in this problem we apply similar principles but the fitness function doesnt check only for the number of 1's present in a string. Instead we define a target string that we want the algorithm to work its way upto.

[Deceptive String problem](deceptive_problem_final.ipynb)

Another extension of the one max problem but with a deceptive fitness function that tricks the genetic algorithm into thinking it is on the path to a good solution.

[Bin Packing problem](final_final_version_notebook.ipynb)

A bin packing problem in which we have developed a genetic algorithm to fit a number of weights into the minimum number of bins possible through an iteration of a few hundred generations.
